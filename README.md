## Express Serverless example app
An Express Serverless example app to illustrate multiple development environments used in my [blog post](https://sangeeta.io/2019/05/01/express-serverless/).

---
The blog post references two sources used to load env files and expose Gateway URL:
  - [serverless-dotenv-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serverless-dotenv-plugin)
  - [How do I get my API Gateway URL?](http://www.goingserverless.com/blog/api-gateway-url)
---
#### Footnote
[Master branch] - example app with API Gateway URL environment variable and multiple envs loading.

[without-gateway-url branch] - example with just multiple envs.
